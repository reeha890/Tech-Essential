**LAB : Deploying an Enterprise Web**

Iâ€™ll create virtual servers, install WordPress, configure security, and even build in high availability using load balancing and auto scaling. Letâ€™s break it down

**Step 1**: Building Your Cloud Environment
ğŸ”¹ 1. Create a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
Think of a VPC as your private network on the cloud. Itâ€™s like your own secure neighborhood where your cloud servers live. In this step, you create one and choose the AP-Singapore region (or any closest to your users).

ğŸ”¹ 2. Set Up Security Rules
Next, you build a security groupâ€”a kind of firewall. You allow traffic from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) for testing, but in real-world setups, youâ€™d want to be more strict for safety.

 **Step 2**: Launching the Servers
ğŸ”¹ 3. Create an ECS (Elastic Cloud Server)
This is your actual web server. You pick CentOS as the operating system and give it basic specs like 1 vCPU and 1GB RAM. You assign it an IP address so you can access it from the internet.

ğŸ”¹ 4. Add a Database (RDS)
Websites like WordPress need databases. Huawei Cloud offers Relational Database Service (RDS)â€”a managed MySQL database that you can easily deploy. No need to worry about backups or maintenanceâ€”Huawei handles that.

**Step 3**: Setting Up the LAMP Stack
Now that your server is up, itâ€™s time to install the LAMP stack:
Linux (already installed)
Apache (web server)
MySQL (database)
PHP (for dynamic content)
You log into your server, install everything with a simple command, and configure Apache to start automatically. You also download and extract WordPress, which is the website software you'll be running.

**Step 4**: Connecting WordPress to the Database
After installing WordPress, you:
Create a new database called wordpress using the RDS console.
Access your serverâ€™s IP in a browser and launch the WordPress installation wizard.
Input the database details (like username, password, IP).
Set your site title, admin account, and boomâ€”youâ€™re live!

**Step 5**: Make Your Website Scalable & Reliable
ğŸ”¹ Use a Load Balancer (ELB)
A load balancer spreads traffic across multiple servers. That way, if one server is overloaded or fails, another picks up the slack.
 Create a System Image
You take a snapshot of your configured server so you can clone it when neededâ€”like making copies of a well-decorated room.
 Set Up Auto Scaling (AS)
With auto scaling, Huawei Cloud automatically adds or removes servers based on traffic. For example:
If CPU usage > 60%, add 1 server.
If CPU usage < 20%, remove 1 server.
Itâ€™s like having a smart system that adjusts resources depending on how many customers are visiting your site.

 **Step 6**: Visit Your Website
Access the load balancerâ€™s public IP and see your WordPress site live on the internet. Thanks to ELB and AS, your site can now handle more users and stay online even during traffic surges.

 **Step 7**: Monitor Your Resources
Head to Cloud Eye, Huaweiâ€™s monitoring tool:
View server performance
Track alarms and issues
Get real-time stats on CPU, memory, and network
